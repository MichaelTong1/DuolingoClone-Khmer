The idea is to create a duolingo clone as well as implementing a Khmer (Cambodian) course. 

A couple things I've learned today:

1. We will be using React Native + Expo to establish quick testing via Fast Refresh (a.k.a. Hot Reloading) and easy deployment to android and iOS
2. [Fast Refresh can be enabled](https://github.com/expo/expo/issues/23104)
3. [Utilize the Pressed component instead of the Button component](https://docs.expo.dev/ui-programming/react-native-styling-buttons/)
